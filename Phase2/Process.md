### Other Tools

Our team is using [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/) as our agile project management tool. It is similar to Trello boards, but it integrates natively with GitHub's issue management system.


###Major Decisions 

One of the first major decisions we made was to make our application a mobile app. We did this because we felt that the Android environment gave us the flexibility needed to create an app with multiple screens and data structures. Also, the syntax for UI styling is very familiar to our team. The second major decision we made was to have our MVP only include the linked-list data structure. We did this because we felt under the time constraints this was mostly likely the best decision for our team. This was the right decision because within the second sprint we were able to get the data structure implemented. The third decision we made was to not have a scrum master. We did this because we felt the process should be more democratic and everyone should have an equal say in the project. This was the right decision because by not appointing a scrum master we had an extra person to work on the app.
