# Structura 

We are happy that we have produced what we thought we would be able to. The main idea of the app is to mainly help univeristy students with understanding various data structures. The app intends to do it using three features. 
The first one being the ability to play with the individual elements in the data structure, and perform various operations on the data structure as a whole.
The second one being the presence of a consise summary of the data structures, that helps the user refresh their knowledge about it in a small amount of time.
The third one being the quizzes. They test the user's knowledge, and help him understand the specefic parts he needs to concentrate on for a particular data structure.

The three functions address the needs of a student in three different scenarios. He can play with the individual elements of the data structure when he is seeing it for the first time in order to completely understand its working. The summaries allow the user to quickly refresh thier concepts and possibly add to their exam cheat sheets. The quizzes allow the user to test his knowledge before an exam or an interview. Hence, Structura provides a complete learning tool for the students.

For this phase, we chose the data structure to be Linked List. The app currently allows a user to play with Linked list nodes, insert or delete them, or even search through the Linked List. The summary feature has also been implemented, and it provides the basic information on a linked list and its operations. However, quizzes have not been included in this release, and will be a part of the next phase.

We wish to implement at least one more data stucture in the next phase and also add the quizzes for all the implemented ones. Hence, after the final phase, Structura will be able to provide with the three-way learning model.
