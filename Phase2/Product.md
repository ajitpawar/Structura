# Structura 

We are happy that we have produced what we thought we would be able to. The key idea of the app is to mainly help university students with understanding various data structures. The app intends to do it using two features. 
The first one being the ability to play with the individual elements in the data structure, and perform various operations on the data structure as a whole.
The second one being the presence of a concise summary of the data structures, that helps the user refresh their knowledge about it in a small amount of time.

The two functions address the needs of a student in two different scenarios. He can play with the individual elements of the data structure when he is seeing it for the first time in order to completely understand its working. The summaries allow the user to quickly refresh their concepts and possibly add to their exam cheat sheets. Hence, Structura aims to provide a complete learning tool for the students.

For this phase, we implemented a single data structure: Singly Linked List. The app currently allows a user to play with Singly Linked list nodes; insert nodes, delete nodes, or search for nodes in a Singly Linked List. The summary feature provides information on the Singly Linked List and all the operations supported by the Singly Linked List that we have implemented for user interactivity (Insert, Delete, and Search).
