The app Structura attempts to help the potential user in the process of learning some basic data structures and the operations that can be performed on them.

Structura features each data structure divided into three fragments. The first one being play, the second one being summary, and the third being quiz. Each of these features were chosen to ensure the complete understanding of the data structure thus fulfilling the requirements for our user stories. Each of the features is described below in detail:

1.	The first feature is the play fragment. The play fragment is the core of the app. It is the first step that any user takes towards understanding a specific data structure. This fragments enables the user to have a hands–on experience with the working of the data structure. In particular, the user gets a chance to “play” with the individual elements of the data structure using various buttons that correspond to various operations that can be performed on the data structure. For example, the Linked List data structure features buttons for inserting, deleting or searching an element. 

	On clicking the buttons, the fragment shows the path that is taken to search for the element in the data structure for any operation by changing the color of the visited elements. This gives a better idea to the user about how an element is looked up for its existence in the structure, before any operation is performed on it. It also demonstrates how different data structures implement a search for an element.

2. 	The next feature is the summary fragment. As the play fragment is important for taking the first step in learning a new data structure, the summary fragment is necessary to keep the knowledge of already known data structures fresh in the user's mind. When we want to learn a new data structure, we go through process of understanding each operation on it on the play fragment. However, when we already know them, but just can’t remember them, we might not want to spend our time doing all that. That’s where the summaries come in. The summary fragment will contain the important facts about the data structure, and its operations in a very concise manner. Thus, reading it will save time and refresh our knowledge about the data structure. The summary is particularly useful during exam times and preparing cheat sheets.

3. The final feature is the quiz fragment. As the other features are important in learning or refreshing knowledge about data structures, this feature is necessary to test the user's understanding. This feature provides simple multiple choice questions about the corresponding data structure, which is a quick way to test for confidence in a topic. It also allows the user to point out the weak areas that they need to concentrate on for a data structure. This feature is useful just before exams, interviews, etc.

So these were the features that we chose to implement in Structura. They provide a three step guide to mastering any data structure. Introduce yourself to it, revise the important concepts, and test your knowledge on it to get a better idea of which areas to concentrate on. 

These features meet the needs of our user stories. Some of the scenarios that we can have are as follows:

a)  Mario is a first year Computer Science student and he wants to get a head start on the topics taught in courses like CSC263. He downloads Structura and plays with the data structures of his liking in order to get a visual, interactive introduction to it. He enjoys how Structura enables him to do things that his textbook can’t.

b)  Lana is a second year student in majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science, and wants to quickly revise some concepts from the topics taught at the beginning of the semester. She uses Structura’s summary feature to read about the operations on a Binary Search Tree, and uses them in problems on AVL trees.

c)  Steve is a third year Computer Engineering student preparing for his interviews at Google. He has revised everything but is nervous whether what he has done is enough or not. He is aware about Structura, and thus pulls it out on his phone, and attempts the quizzes on various data structures. He gets an average of 90% on them and now he feels much more confident about his interview.

So these were some times when an app like Sturctura comes in handy. We being students ourselves, understand the needs of one. Thus have tried to implement some useful features that act as tools that aid learning. We hope our effort is useful for someone.
