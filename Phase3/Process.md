## Process

Our group closely followed the Scrum process for both Phase 2 and Phase 3 with mixed results. Explained below are a few things that did and didn't work well for us.

### Things that worked well
We found that making use of GitHub issues was extremely helpful for our development process. We followed the convention that when a new issue is created, it must reference the branch and (if possible) the user story it is working on. Furthermore, any new feature update or fix must happen by raising a new issue instead of modifying the existing one. This allowed us to have a clean, traceable work history. Use of GitHub issues also meant that all members of the team were abreast with what is happening across all different branches and their progress so far. <br>
We also found that using Slack and GitHub in parelell was very useful. Using Slack, we were able to talk to one another individually and the group as a whole very easily. With this addition it made solving conflicts, getting up dates on features, fixing bugs exponentially easier. Also, using Slack increased productivity drastically. Opening and using Slack put the team in a work mentality and really improved output from the group. In comparison to facebook, which we were initally using, Slack definitely increased not only the amount of group interaction but also product quality.  

### Things that didn't work well
Although the Scrum process was an important part of our development cycle, we realized a limitation with it. In Phase 3, it became clear to us that we were missing an "overview" of our workflow. We found it hard to tell what state of the workflow we are in (Dev, Test, Release, Deploy) just by looking at our issues and branches. There were times when multiple items were being pursued at a time, often failing to meet milestones on time. There seemed to be a need to visualize our workflow and put limits on items in progress in a given state.


### Ideal process
Evidently, an ideal process for us might be a mix of Scrum and Kanban. Scrum will allow us to split our work into small, concrete deliverables while Kanban will allow us to visualize the workflow and limit WIP (Work In Progress). An example of how Kanban process might look like for us is shown below:
