## Individual Reports

### Dhyey Sejpal (dhyeysejpal)

•	My most significant individual contribution came in Phase 3. I worked on redesigning the Linked list play fragment, which was implemented by drawing stuff on canvas using a drawable. I helped designing the views, and wrote the functions to search through the linked list, which formed the base of the search and delete operations. Then, I also helped in extending the same functions for implementing the operations for a binary search tree. The commits are in the branch 55-play-canvas. Debugged search BST function.

•	This project was a big opportunity to learn many technical issues. The biggest was using git. I was familiar with version control system before but this project helped me learn a lot of new things like code reviews, pull requests, etc. Other than that, I learnt many Android concepts like canvas drawing, views and fragments, etc.

•	As a team member, my main strength comes in project management. I feel that I am good at making plans about the execution of the project and successfully following them with the whole team. Apart from that, I am good at handling the non – technical stuff like the write – ups needed about the product, process, etc.

•	My main weakness as a team member was being a bit miscommunicated with the other team members. I was not able to allot enough time to the project in its early phase and also wasn’t actively participating in the code reviews, and felt disconnected. I tried to improve on the third phase and feel that I did a better job than phase 2.

### Amit Prabhakar (Slammedskyline)

•	My most significant individual contribution came in Phase 3. I worked on the BST play fragment which allowed us to draw a BST including search, insert, and delete. I also did the live demo and presentation along with Dhyey and process.md and Architecture.md.

•	During this phase I learned a lot about the android development structure including views, activities, intents, and styling. Also I learned about git and the development cycle that being pulls and pushes as well as pull requests. 

•	As a team member, my main strength was communication. I was constantly talking to team members and getting up dates on specific features and conflicts. I also assisted, where I could, with other team members work which included testing, proof reading, and general reviewing of written documents.

•	My main weakness as a team member was time management. Unfortunately, I was not about to give enough time to certain aspects of the project due to time constraints. I feel like I did a better job of this during phase 2 but definitely could have done more during phase 3.

### Omar hamdan (un2n)
 
- My most significant individual contribution came in Phase 2. I worked on the start page which the app welcomes the user with. Furthermore, I acquired Zenhub.io licenses for the repository so that the team can enjoy and enhanced Github experience. Debugged search BST function.

- While working on our Android app, I learned much about activities, views, fragments, git branching, modern app development with scrum (I had a waterfall background) and Markdown.

- I try to keep myself up to date with important issues and code changes so I can be a reference to anyone asking about anything regarding the application. I have extensive knowledge about development tools and virtual machines so I aided in distributing alternative emulators to the default Eclipse emulator. 

- I didn't expect Android development to advance greatly in one year. My knowledge from CSC207 wasn't sufficient to understand some of the newer stuff so the project was a new learning process for me. Thankfully, it was a positive learning process.

### Ishan Thukral (ishanthukral) 

* I had two significant contributions. Firstly, I implemented the Linked List interactivity in Phase 2. This included the ability to add a node, delete it and search through the linked list to find a specific node. This primarily involved the use of the Android Canvas API. In Phase 3, I worked on the Quiz section of the app. Along with Ajit, we implemented the quiz fragment. I worked on setting up the adapter to control the list view of question and the singleton question store class. I also worked on improving the UI of the Quiz layout. 

* This phase was a good opportunity to implement some of the object oriented principles we have been learning in class. While implementing the quiz section I made sure to use classes that were single use and even ended up using the singleton design pattern. In addition I learnt a lot about Android development - canvas, adapters, list views, fragments, activities etc.

* I tried to help my teammates with Android issues. Over the course of the semester I tried to arrange regular meeting so everyone was up-to-date with each other's work on the project. I participated in code reviews and implemented major core portions of the app. 

* I feel I could have been more active and frequent on Github and code reviews.

### Sean Williams (SeanWiz)

- My most significant individual contribution came in Phase 3, where I implemented the binary search tree data structure, which was needed for the play function to work properly. I also contributed towards the building of the necessary activity, page adapter and play fragment for the binary search tree section.
- While working on our project, I learned a lot more about how an Android application works, what activities, fragments and resource files do and how they interact with one another to produce a working product. I also learned about the different features of Git, such as working with and rebasing branches.
- As a team member, I was always committed to ensuring I accomplished the tasks that I had been given. I would always put in an effort to make sure I was able to do my part, and if I had an issue, I tried to resolve it as soon as possible, be it through finding a solution or asking for help, so as not to hold up the rest of the group.
- I felt my main weakness was communication. There were times where I felt I was out of touch with the rest of the group and what they were doing, and I feel I may have been able to have contributed more if I communicated better.

### Ajit Pawar (ajitpawar)
* My biggest contribution came in Phase 3 where I implemented the "Quiz" section of the app. My work can be seen here on my branch 53-quiz and issue [#53](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team2-repo/issues/53). I was responsible for designing the layout and implementing the  functionality. Parts of the Quiz was refactored by Ishan Thukral in #54. Also, in Phase 2, I had a minor contribution in creating the sliding tabs.

* Since this was my first Android project, I faced a learning curve in understanding the different components of an Adroid app and how they interacted with each other. In Phase 2, when I implemented sliding tabs [#26](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team2-repo/pull/26), I learnt a lot about Fragments, Adapters, Views, Activity and XML Layouts. As such, it was a good opportunity to apply the design patterns learnt in class to an Android project. It was also an excellent way for me to learn how the Scrum process really works.

* I kept myself upto date with new commits and breaking changes in our code so that I can be active in the decision making process. I helped with code reviews and pointed out bugs and glitches whenever I [spotted them](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team2-repo/pull/59#issuecomment-87448736).

* If I had more experience in app development, I could have contributed to implementing more interactive features for our app. And I need to brush up my Java a little bit :)

### Vaishali Deswal (vdeswal)

* My most significant contribution was in both phase 2 and phase 3. During phase 2, I implemented the summary fragment for Linked List data structure in the app [#16] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team2-repo/issues/16). During phase 3, I collaborated on implementing the quiz feature of the app. I compiled the list of multiple choice questions for both Linked List and Binary Search Trees. [#56] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team2-repo/issues/56). Along with some [code reviews] (https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team2-repo/pull/46), I contributed in creating the presentation slides for the project proposal and the final demo. 

* This course was a great opportunity to learn many technical concepts that are critical in the software engineering industry. The main tool being able to use git properly. Initially, this was a challenge for me as I only ever used git/github for personal projects and not for a collaborative project. This led me to learn various features such as Pull Requests, code reviews and resolving merge conflicts. Another issue was learning Android development. I learned about the different components that make up the app such as the UI layouts, views, fragments, etc. 

* As a team member, I would say my strength is communication and being a team player. Throughout the project, I have effectively communicated with my group members on planning and implementing various features of the app. I also work with the goal being efficient and timely completion of various phases of the project.

* My main weakness as a team member would be that I did not contribute as much technical inputs as I would have liked to due to my lack of experience in mobile app development and being a bit outdated with Java.
