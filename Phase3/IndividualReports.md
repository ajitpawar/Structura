## Individual Reports

### Name (GitHub username) 
Here is an example of a fake report, just to give you an idea of the format we are 
expecting. We would like you to be concise yet informative. 
* My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of 
Component X (links to relevant and interesting source­files/commits/issues). 
* While working on our Android app (and then later in class), I learned about 
adapters (links to relevant and interesting source­files/commits/issues).
* I am always helping my teammates ­ I am the most experienced coder on the 
team, and I helped other teammates set up their development environment, and 
get up to speed with the tools we've used (give examples of specific tools). 
* I could keep people more informed of what I am doing ­ I made a few large 
commits that conflicted with everybody else's code, and merging everything 
wasted a lot of our time.

### Dhyey Sejpal (dhyeysejpal)

•	My most significant individual contribution came in Phase 3. I worked on redesigning the Linked list play fragment, which was implemented by drawing stuff on canvas using a drawable. I helped designing the views, and wrote the functions to search through the linked list, which formed the base of the search and delete operations. Then, I also helped in extending the same functions for implementing the operations for a binary search tree. The commits are in the branch 55-play-canvas.

•	This project was a big opportunity to learn many technical issues. The biggest was using git. I was familiar with version control system before but this project helped me learn a lot of new things like code reviews, pull requests, etc. Other than that, I learnt many Android concepts like canvas drawing, views and fragments, etc.

•	As a team member, my main strength comes in project management. I feel that I am good at making plans about the execution of the project and successfully following them with the whole team. Apart from that, I am good at handling the non – technical stuff like the write – ups needed about the product, process, etc.

•	My main weakness as a team member was being a bit miscommunicated with the other team members. I was not able to allot enough time to the project in its early phase and also wasn’t actively participating in the code reviews, and felt disconnected. I tried to improve on the third phase and feel that I did a better job than phase 2.

### Amit Prabhakar (Slammedskyline)

•	My most significant individual contribution came in Phase 3. I worked on the BST play fragment which allowed us to draw a BST including search, insert, and delete. I also did the live demo and presentation along with Dhyey and process.md and Architecture.md.

•	During this phase I learned a lot about the android development sturcture including views, activities, intents, and styling. Also I learned about git and the development cycle that being pulls and pushes as well as pull requests.

•	As a team member, my main strength was communication. I was constantly talking to team members and getting up dates on specific features and conflicts. I also assisted, where I could, with other team members work which included testing, proof reading, and general reviewing of written documents.

•	My main weakness as a team member was time management. Unfortunately, I was not about to give enough time to certain aspects of the project due to time constraints. I feel like I did a better job of this during phase 2 but definitly could have done more during phase 3.
