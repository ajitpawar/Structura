•	My most significant individual contribution came in Phase 3. I worked on redesigning the Linked list play fragment, which was implemented by drawing stuff on canvas using a drawable. I helped designing the views, and wrote the functions to search through the linked list, which formed the base of the search and delete operations. Then, I also helped in extending the same functions for implementing the operations for a binary search tree. The commits are in the branch 55-play-canvas.

•	This project was a big opportunity to learn many technical issues. The biggest was using git. I was familiar with version control system before but this project helped me learn a lot of new things like code reviews, pull requests, etc. Other than that, I learnt many Android concepts like canvas drawing, views and fragments, etc.

•	As a team member, my main strength comes in project management. I feel that I am good at making plans about the execution of the project and successfully following them with the whole team. Apart from that, I am good at handling the non – technical stuff like the write – ups needed about the product, process, etc.

•	My main weakness as a team member was being a bit miscommunicated with the other team members. I was not able to allot enough time to the project in its early phase and also wasn’t actively participating in the code reviews, and felt disconnected. I tried to improve on the third phase and feel that I did a better job than phase 2.
