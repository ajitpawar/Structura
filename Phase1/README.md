#User Stories

###Piotr Recalls an Epiphany (State Saving)
Piotr had an epiphany of singly linked lists one night and decided to carry out his suspicions on the Structra app. The interactivity of SLLs confirmed his theory, thus Piotr closed Structra and slept peacefully the night before his midterm. In the morning, Piotr recalls his epiphany and decides to review what he did on Structra. Once he launches the app, it brings him straight to where he left it off with all his interactions rendered. Satisfied with what he reviews, Piotr confidently faces his midterm. 
 
###Piotr Tames the List (Searching)
Structra contains many topics to view. Piotr can navigate the different topics by searching using keywords. So, flipping between reading about singly linked lists to binary heaps is very easy for Piotr since all he does is open the overflow menu and entry his query at the top of said menu.
