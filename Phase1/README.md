## Choosing The Project
Data structures are fundamental building blocks of Computer Science. In today's world, the need to conquer the inherent complexity of these concepts is critical for success. But, learning data structures can be intimidating for some. The abstractness of the concept can be hard to grasp and students can get stuck trying to "imagine" how it works. Existing teaching methods like videos (Khan Academy) and  text-based forums (StackOverflow) don't quite solve the problem. And this is why we chose to build Structra. We chose this problem space because we recognized there was not a single platform that helps students learn about data structures in an interactive manner. Our product will an insightful, organized and immersive way of learning about Trees, Lists, Hash Tables and Objects. Technical content will come from verified sources like textbooks and Wikipedia. Users will have an opportunity to choose from variety of topics with varying difficulty levels. As an added feature, we thought of implementing exercises and quizzes to give the user an opportunity to validate their learning. We will be making use of open source API and bootstraps to help us with the interactivity of the UI.

In essence, we wish to build a product that helps students learn by visualizing the abstract concepts in Computer Science


## Personas
Savio is a 2nd year Computer Science student at UofT’s
St. George campus. He is single. He lives on campus 
in the New College residences and Dons on one of the floors.
Because of the fairly long and busy days, Savio usually spends 
most of day in the residence building either doing school work or don work.
Savio has always been a very outgoing student who has been very involved in the social aspect of university, that being said he still manages to take a full
course load and keep up in his academics.

###Piotr Recalls an Epiphany (State Saving)
Piotr had an epiphany of singly linked lists one night and decided to carry out his suspicions on the Structra app. The interactivity of SLLs confirmed his theory, thus Piotr closed Structra and slept peacefully the night before his midterm. In the morning, Piotr recalls his epiphany and decides to review what he did on Structra. Once he launches the app, it brings him straight to where he left it off with all his interactions rendered. Satisfied with what he reviews, Piotr confidently faces his midterm. 
 
###Piotr Tames the List (Searching)
Structra contains many topics to view. Piotr can navigate the different topics by searching using keywords. So, flipping between reading about singly linked lists to binary heaps is very easy for Piotr since all he does is open the overflow menu and entry his query at the top of said menu. 


#MVP
Structra is a tool that allows people to learn data structures efficiently. The app consists of a list of various data structures to start from. They will be ordered in a particular manner so as to maximize the learning, and guide the beginners through the process. However, if you are not a beginner, the app has a feature that allows you to search for specific topics to learn. You can look up for any of the available data structures and study them specifically, instead of going through the guided sections. Another cool feature in the app is being able to save your state. If you are in a hurry, or wish to look at your progress at a later time, Structra’s “Save my Progress” feature will be handy. An app cannot appeal the masses or please the current group of customers if it is not easy to use. The users will be mostly students, ranging from ones in their first year, who can use this app to get a head start, or second year, who can revise and practice their topics here, or even higher year students who can brush up their skills on these topics before interviews, or for other courses. That’s why Structra has a great, fluid UI, which would not only guide users through the app, but the interactivity in visualizing the data structure operations provides a unique learning experience, which is not possible to have in the class rooms. It allows you to play with the individual elements of the data structure. And if one has already gone through the larning process using Structra, and wants a quick revision before his examinations, or an interview, Structra provides the “Summary” feature, which will consists of a brief description of the data structure, its operations, applications, and some of the abstract data types it supports. Thus, Structra is “the complete learning tool” for these concepts. 

Getting through this product will not be easy. There are obvious hurdles in this process. Some of them will be the difference in knowledge base of the group. But that is where we will change it into our advantage. People from different backgrounds have different skills, and hence we will divide the tasks according to everyone’s strengths. Apart from that, co-ordination and schedule conflicts will be a problem, but then we have Git, and Slack that will keep us organized.
